# I wanna play 2048

I know. Just do this:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.

The default grid size is 6 but you can change it on the URL like `localhost:4000/new?size=5`. Should work with other values but the layout might not cope :)

# I'm a nerd

No worries. You can run some tests and build some dopamine with `mix test`. The coverage ain't high but it covers the most important part of the game: sliding tiles.

# I wanna play with my dog

I got you covered! Just launch another window and go to the same URL. Now you can all play!
